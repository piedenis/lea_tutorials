        "\n",
        "Lea is a Python library for dealing with discrete probability distributions in a simple way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lea allows you modeling a broad range of random phenomena, like gambling, weather, finance, etc. It lets you define random variables with given probability distributions on any Python object; then, these random variables can be combined together using usual arithmetic, comparison, logical operators, joints, conditional probability and even user-defined functions. Lea can then calculate the probability distributions on these derived random variables; it provides also usual probability indicators (e.g. the mean and the variance) and measures from information theory (e.g. the entropy). Generation of random samples can be performed on any probability distribution, even non-uniform. Advanced functions let you build up probabilistic models using joint probability distributions (JPD), conditional probability tables (CPT), Bayes networks and Markov chains. Lea is definitely a toolkit for *probabilistic\n",
        "programming*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lea is designed to be easy to use, putting the focus on the expressiveness of the models and hiding as much as possible the underlying mathematics. It can be used as a toolkit for teaching probability theory and probabilistic programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lea, as of version 3, offers different ways to represent probabilities, including floating-point numbers, fractions and even symbolic variables (thanks to [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) library). You can easily switch from one representation to another. Whatever the probability representation, the same calculation algorithm is used, producing results with the probability type you've chosen.\n",
        "\n",
        "The probability calculation in Lea is performed through an original algorithm, the *Statues algorithm*, which is based on generators and variable binding. This algorithm performs *exact calculation*. The implementation has been tuned to optimize the CPU. However, should the combinatorial become prohibitively large, an approximate algorithm based on Monte-Carlo sampling is also available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lea is a _pure Python_ library. Most of the functions do not require installation of other packages. For advanced functions however, you may take advantage of the following optional libraries (these are automatically detected and integrated when you use Lea): [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) for plotting histograms, [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) for symbolic calculations and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) for building joint probability distributions. Note that these three libraries are part of the [Anaconda distribution](http://www.anaconda.com); so, if you install Lea within your Anaconda environment, then you have access to all Lea features without worrying about installation.\n",
        "\n",

        "The first thing to do when working with Lea is to define a probability distribution that models a given phenomenon. In Lea, probability distributions are discrete and finite; internally, any probability distribution X is defined by a collection of associations v : P(X=v), which defines for any possible value v of X, the probability that X=v. Such collection is named a probability mass function or, for short, a pmf. So, in Lea, defining a probability distribution means defining a pmf.\n",

This structure is actually a *direct acyclic graph* (DAG) where each node is either an elementary probability distribution or an operation to be performed on other nodes (addition, multiplication, etc.). If the given expression is used in other expressions, new graphs (also DAG) are built in turn, referring to the already built graphs. Then, when you ask to display results, the real calculation of the pmf takes place, using the built graph to browse and process the values with their probabilities.
