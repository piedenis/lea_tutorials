Lea can then calculate the probability distributions on these derived random variables; it provides also usual probability indicators (e.g. the mean and the variance) and measures from information theory (e.g. the entropy). Generation of random samples can be performed on any probability distribution, even non-uniform. Advanced functions let you build up probabilistic models using joint probability distributions (JPD), conditional probability tables (CPT), Bayes networks and Markov chains. Lea is definitely a toolkit for _probabilistic \n","programming_. \n","\n","Lea is designed to be easy to use, putting the focus on the expressiveness of the models and hiding as much as possible the underlying mathematics. It can be used as a toolkit for teaching probability theory and probabilistic programming.\n","\n","Lea, as of version 3, offers different ways to represent probabilities, including floating-point numbers, fractions and even symbolic variables (thanks to [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) library). You can easily switch from one representation to another. Whatever the probability representation, the same calculation algorithm is used, producing results with the probability type you've chosen.\n","\n","The probability calculation in Lea is performed through an original algorithm, the _Statues algorithm_, which is based on generators and variable binding. This algorithm performs _exact calculation_. The implementation has been tuned to optimize the CPU. However, should the combinatorial become prohibitively large, an approximate algorithm based on Monte-Carlo sampling is also available.\n","\n","Lea is a _pure Python_ library. Most of the functions do not require installation of other packages. For advanced functions however, you may take advantage of the following optional libraries (these are automatically detected and integrated when you use Lea): [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) for plotting histograms, [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) for symbolic calculations and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) for building joint probability distributions. Note that these three libraries are part of the [Anaconda distribution](http://www.anaconda.com); so, if you install Lea within your Anaconda environment, then you have access to all Lea features without worrying about installation.\n","\n","Lea runs on Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.x.\n","\n","Lea is available under LGPL license.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Prerequisites\n","\n","Lea 3 is the baseline for the present tutorial.\n","If you are Lea 2 user, please read the [Lea 3 vs Lea 2](#markdown-header-lea-3-vs-lea-2) section.\n","\n","In order to execute the statements given in the present tutorial, you need\n","\n","* [Python](http://www.python.org/downloads) 2.6+ or 3.x - see [download page](http://www.python.org/downloads)\n","* Lea 3 module installed - see  [Lea installation page](Installation).\n","\n","Lea is a pure Python module.

Version 2 of Lea internally represents probability as _integer weights_, the probabilities are displayed as fractions and easily converted to float if needed. If needed, you have still access to [Lea 2 basic tutorial page](LeaPyTutorial0), as well as [Lea 2 advanced tutorial pages](LeaPyTutorial1). Most of this Lea 2 material has been incorporated and adapted in the present Lea 3 tutorial. Note that Lea 3 is not backward compatible with Lea 2; several methods have new names/behaviors. The rationale of these evolutions is mainly to improve **ease-of-use**, **clarity** and **openness**. Also, Lea 3 is more \"pythonic\" and, in particular, it conforms to PEP8 naming conventions (e.g. `as_joint` instead of `asJoint`).\n","\n","On the 'openness' matter, Lea 3, contrarily to previous versions, is [able to represent probabilities in different ways, depending on your preferences](Lea3_Tutorial_2#markdown-header-changing-probability-representation): floats, fractions, decimals and even [symbolic variables](Lea3_Tutorial_3#markdown-header-symbolic-computation-with-probabilities). Also, the design is open to other, user-defined, types for representing probabilities, provided that they support the basic arithmetic operations. The default type for probabilities is the floating-point representation, which is a conservative choice, but it is up to you to decide which type is the most convenient. The choice of fractions representation (made incidentally in Lea 2) is well suited for many probability domains like gambling; unlike floating-point numbers, fractions allow for unlimited precision of results.\n","\n","# What's next?\n","\n","Thank you for reading the present tutorial page! We hope that you found it enough clear and informative.\n","\n","You should be able now to define your own probability distributions and combine them to model many phenomena with uncertainties. You can find more examples in the [Examples page](Lea3_Examples).\n","\n","However, Lea can do many, many more than the topics explained on the present page! If you are looking for advanced topics, jump to\n","\n","* [tutorial [2/3]](Lea3_Tutorial_2) - standard distributions, changing probability representation, joint distributions, Bayesian networks, Markov chains, â€¦\n","* [tutorial [3/3]](Lea3_Tutorial_3) - plotting, drawing without replacement, machine learning, information theory, MC estimation, symbolic calculation, â€¦\n","\n","For enhancements or bugs, please [create issues on bitbucket Lea page](http://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea/issues).\n","\n","Feel free also to send an e-mail to [pie.denis@skynet.be](mailto:pie.denis@skynet.be) (English or French spoken).
